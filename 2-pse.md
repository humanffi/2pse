You're focusing on the wrong thing.

We want people to use ethereum. We don't care how abstract that use is, so long as they use it.

Building offchain tools backed by cryptographicly provable data structures enables every digital citizen to use ethereum, but abstracted by decentralized tech and zk proofs.

ZK proofs are _information compression_. They are _obscenely_ effective at compression. In fact information compression is infinite, data compression is not just finite, but in some cases 0/impossible. e.g. we can prove execution of a program of unbounded length using 7 points on an elliptic curve.

We don't _want_ applications that interact with the blockchain directly. We want applications like twitter to use a database that is compatible with ethereum as a _feature_. Centralized tech is used to provide applications to users. Decentralized tech is used to _align them_.

Let's focus up here.
