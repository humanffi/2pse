The privacy and scaling team is a group of ~100 software engineers, ux designers, and mathematicians. We actively work on maybe 10-20 projects and passively maintain many more.

This group is very loosely governed/managed. Individual projects have significant agency in making decisions about what is being built, and how it's being built. Project try to advance our understanding and use of modern cryptographic structures.

Directing such a group is difficult because the correct direction is undefined. The tools we have are powerful, but we haven't discovered many ways to impact users. It's difficult for non-engineers to make decisions because the state of the tooling is complex and rapidly changing.
